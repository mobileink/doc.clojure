    <p>
      The basic approach: describe the problem, then describe general
      strategies for addressing the problem, then describe
      Leiningen-specific solutions, then give an example.
    </p>

    <p>
      Key distinctions: Leiningen <q>task</q> (i.e. command)
      v. developer's task (e.g. test, document); project map
      (i.e. configuration) v. command
    </p>

    <note>
      Leiningen's terminology should be changed to use <q>command</q>
      where it currently uses <q>task</q>.  This is because the tasks
      are not in fact tasks; e.g. <userinput>lein compile</userinput>
      is a command from the user to Leiningen rather than a task to be
      accomplished.  We need to reserve the word <q>task</q> to refer
      to <q>user tasks</q>, the tasks confronting the developer, which
      appear as problems to be solved.  So for example the first task
      is merely to configure the project.  The way to solve this
      problem is to write the project.clj and set up the directory
      structure.

      Plan of the work:
      <dl>
	<dlentry>
	  <dt>Overview</dt>
	  <dd>installation, projects, infrastructure</dd>
	</dlentry>
	<dlentry>
	  <dt>Project Maps</dt>
	  <dd>How the projmap is constructed at runtime; how tasks use
	  the projmap to drive configuration of the </dd>

	<dlentry>
	  <dt>Tasks</dt>
	  <dd>
	  Two kinds of task:
	  <ul>
	    <li>Dev tasks, e.g coding, testing, QA, etc</li>
	    <li>Leiningen <q>tasks</q>, i.e. commands</li>
	  </ul>
	  General description of tasks; commonly used tasks with examples
	  </dd>
	</dlentry>
	<dlentry>
	  <dt>Infrastructure:  Respositories</dt>
	  <dd>role of repos; how to specify, etc. and how Leiningen searches, etc</dd>
